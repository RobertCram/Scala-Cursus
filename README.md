## Accessing subprojects
Use the remote explorer in the activity bar. Right click on the project subdirectory in the Dev container and chose "Open folder in container". This seems to be the only way to get Metals to "play nice" with subprojects (i.e.: have tests show up in the testing pane, etc.)

## Additional downloads for Week 6:
To be able to test the code without Internet access, you can use a small dataset. This small graph contains all the pages that are at distance 2 from the Scala (programming language) article. The dataset might be incorrect or out of date and should be used only for testing.

You can download the file from https://moocs.scala-lang.org/~dockermoocs/effective-scala/smallwiki.db
Please put the file inside a directory named enwiki-dataset, in the project root directory. The path to the dataset (relative to the project root directory) should be enwiki-dataset/smallwiki.db
